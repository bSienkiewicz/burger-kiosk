# Burger Kiosk
Burger Kiosk is a Vue-based project developed as an Electron app, forming part of the larger "Project Burger" university initiative. This kiosk application is designed for restaurant environments, allowing users to place orders through a dedicated app. The app communicates with a REST backend for order processing and utilizes Cloudinary for image hosting. This project served as a learning opportunity to explore both Vue.js and Electron technologies.

# Features

- Electron Integration: Packaged as an Electron app for a seamless desktop experience.
- REST Backend Connection: Communicates with a backend server for order processing.
- Image Hosting with Cloudinary: Manages and serves images through Cloudinary.
- Learning Experience: First major project utilizing Vue and Electron.

# ‚ùóWhy login credentials are not in the .env file?
Because that was the professor's requirement. 
This login data had to be somewhere in the code to prove that a database was attached to the project and that the data in the application was not random.

# Setup and Installation
This project is not intended to be downloaded or ran on its own, as it requires additional setup including Cloudinary account configuration, MySQL database hosting and backend deployment. However, if you're interested in exploring the source code, feel free to do so.
